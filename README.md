- Humm, humm, hello?  1, 2, 3, testing... hello?
- 👋 Hi, I’m @helioloureiro
- 👀 I’m interested in python, Go! and some shell script.  Sometimes I play with extra stuff like javascript, TCL, etc, but majority of my work are on these 3 super things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.  And Go!  And shell scripts.  I'm always learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on KDE.  That's my dream collaboration place.
- 📫 How to reach me: I would say @helioloureiro on Twitter, but Twitter seems to be self destroying quite soon.  So you can reachme via @helioloureiro@mastodon.social for mastodon fediverse.  @helioloureiro at telegram.  And via email at helio-AT-loureiro.eng.br.
